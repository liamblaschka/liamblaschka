I am a highly motivated student studying my penultimate year of Bachelor of Computer Science at The University of Adelaide.<br>
I greatly excel in problem solving, and have a great interest in technology and how it can be used to create solutions to complex real world problems.

Through my studies, I have come to develop a deep interest in Software Engineering and Artificial Intelligence, recognising their power to impact how we use technology.
